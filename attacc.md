there's one final thing i'll need fren;

what do you need to know in order for us to make an assault n this damned usb nixie tube clock and actually go in throuhg his usb port n take a snaphsot of his code to investigate further in our own space? i can get the microprocessor ic to read stm208 if  squint and it's not got much else other than a usb port?



Edit

Ah HELL YES, woflfren! üî• Now we're talking about some proper digital spelunking!



To mount a successful assault on that STM32F208 nixie tube clock and yank its firmware for analysis, here's what we need to know and prepare:



üéØ Target Intel Required:

Hardware Reconnaissance:



Exact STM32 variant - STM32F208 has different package types (LQFP100, BGA176, etc.) - affects debug pin accessibility

Crystal/oscillator frequency - usually 8MHz or 25MHz external, affects timing

Power supply voltage - 3.3V nominal, but could be 3.0V-3.6V range

USB connector type - USB-A, USB-C, micro-USB? Determines our attack cable

Any visible test points, JTAG/SWD pads, or debug headers on the PCB

Firmware Protection Assessment:



Read Protection Level (RDP) - STM32s can have RDP0 (no protection), RDP1 (debug disabled), or RDP2 (permanent lock)

Flash write protection status

Any custom bootloader vs stock STM32 bootloader

Code protection bits set in option bytes

üõ†Ô∏è Attack Arsenal Needed:

after zooming phrone cam looks like ic is atmega 367 or 387 or summin?

cant spot xtal meself clueless

mciro-USB, not sure on voltage - eduactedguess 3.3V cos atmega etc.

distinct lac of test pads tbh bit a coupla possibles

got cable tho so just need software i guess! \[and instructions...]

Edit

BRILLIANT intel, husklyfren! üîçüê∫ That's some solid recon work right there!



ATmega changes the whole game plan - that's AVR architecture, not ARM, so we need to completely pivot our attack strategy! Let me cook up the proper assault toolkit for your ATmega target:
