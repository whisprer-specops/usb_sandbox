🔬 ===== PROTOCOL FINGERPRINT =====
📋 Device: Ukrainian_Nixie_Clock_TRCorp

📦 Command Structure:
  Header: true (length: Some(2))
  Checksum: None
  Endianness: Little

⏱️ Timing Characteristics:
  Avg Response: 2.50ms
  Periodic: Time Query every 500ms (confidence: 80.0%)

🎯 Common Patterns:
  Command Header: [AA, 55] (freq: 12)
     Function: Protocol framing

💡 SUSPECTED PROTOCOL DETAILS:
  🔸 Uses AA 55 command headers
  🔸 55 AA response headers
  🔸 Sequence numbering for cmd/response matching
  🔸 Command structure: [AA 55] [SEQ] [CMD] [LEN] [DATA...]
  🔸 Response structure: [55 AA] [SEQ] [CMD] [LEN] [DATA...]
  🔸 Command 0x10 = Get Time
  🔸 Command 0x20 = Get Status
  🔸 Command 0x30 = Set Brightness
