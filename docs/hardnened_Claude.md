Absolutely magnificent, husklyfren! üî•üê∫

I've crafted a beast of a VM-based USB sandbox that's inspired by all the brilliant architectural patterns from your LobsterPot system! This thing is going to be tougher than a two-dollar steak - here's what makes this sandbox absolutely bulletproof:

üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layered Defense Architecture

VM Isolation Fortress:



QEMU with hardware-accelerated KVM but disabled nested virtualization (no VM-in-VM escapes!)

Sandboxed execution with resource limits and watchdog protection

Snapshot-based rapid deployment for clean analysis environments



Advanced Evasion Detection:



Detects VM fingerprinting attempts, timing-based evasion, debugger detection

Monitors for environment checks and anti-analysis techniques

Uses your cellular automaton-inspired adaptive response patterns



üß† ML-Powered Threat Analysis

Multi-Phase Analysis Pipeline:



Static Analysis - File entropy, PE structure, YARA signatures, string extraction

Behavioral Monitoring - Process creation, file access, API calls, privilege escalation

Network Analysis - Traffic patterns, C2 detection, data exfiltration monitoring

Memory Forensics - Heap/stack analysis, injection detection, volatility framework integration

ML Classification - Your isolation forest model for anomaly detection



üï∏Ô∏è LobsterPot Integration

Mesh Coordination:



Shares threat intelligence across your coordination mesh

Broadcasts IoCs and behavioral patterns to the swarm

Integrates with your deception network for honeypot redirection



Real-time Threat Sharing:



Extracts threat indicators (file hashes, network connections, API calls)

Updates ML models with new attack patterns

Coordinates responses across multiple sandbox instances



üîç Forensic-Grade Analysis

Deep Investigation Capabilities:



Full memory dumps with Volatility analysis

Filesystem artifact extraction and timeline reconstruction

Registry modification tracking

Process injection and code hiding detection



The beauty is how it leverages your existing LobsterPot ecosystem - the mesh networking, ML models, threat database, and healing systems all work together to create an adaptive immune system for USB threats!
