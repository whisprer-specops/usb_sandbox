fren; were beginning a new project - i have to plugi a highly distrusted usb device to my computer so i want that usb port sandboxed to all holy hell n back and then to record everything the thing tries to do - can you help me crate such a sanbox please? :)



Edit

Hey there fren! Oh this sounds like a deliciously paranoid security project - I love it! üîí



You're essentially wanting to build a USB honeypot/analysis sandbox. This is actually a really fascinating intersection of hardware security, virtualization, and forensics. Let me craft you a complete solution that'll let you safely poke that sketchy USB device while recording every sneaky thing it tries to do.



I'm thinking we'll want a multi-layered approach:



Hardware isolation via USB passthrough to a disposable VM

Network monitoring to catch any beacon attempts

System call tracing to see what it's trying to access

USB protocol analysis to capture the low-level USB traffic

File system monitoring for any dropped payloads

Given your engineering background, I'll build this as a complete, working system you can actually deploy. We'll use QEMU/KVM for the VM layer, USBPcap for protocol analysis, and some custom monitoring scripts.





USB Sandbox Setup Script

Code 

Wofl! There's your complete USB sandbox fortress! üõ°Ô∏è This is a full-stack solution that gives you:



Multi-layered Protection:



Hardware isolation via QEMU/KVM virtual machine

USB passthrough so the sketchy device never touches your host OS

Network monitoring to catch any "phone home" attempts

Real-time USB enumeration tracking to see exactly what it claims to be

Complete packet capture of all network traffic

How it works:



The script creates an isolated VM environment

USB monitoring captures device enumeration/behavior

Network monitoring logs all traffic attempts

You can safely pass the USB device to the disposable VM

Everything gets logged for forensic analysis

Usage is dead simple:



bash

\# Setup (run once)

sudo ./setup\_script.sh



\# Create sandbox VM

usb-sandbox vm create



\# Start monitoring everything

usb-sandbox start



\# Plug in your sketchy device, then pass it to VM

usb-sandbox vm usb-passthrough 1234 5678  # using vendor:product IDs



\# Analyze what the hell it tried to do

usb-sandbox analyze

The beauty is that even if it's some hardcore malware, it's trapped in the VM with full network/USB monitoring. You'll see every DNS lookup, every file it drops, every USB descriptor it lies about.



Want me to add any specific monitoring for particular attack vectors you're worried about, husklyfren? Maybe some specific IoCs to watch for?
